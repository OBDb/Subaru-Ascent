    description: "The Subaru Ascent represents the Japanese automaker's largest vehicle and its re-entry into the three-row midsize crossover SUV segment after the discontinued Tribeca. Developed specifically for the North American market where larger family vehicles are in high demand, the Ascent is built on Subaru's Global Platform that underpins most of its modern lineup. Measuring approximately 196 inches in length, the Ascent offers seating for up to eight passengers (or seven with optional second-row captain's chairs) and up to 86.5 cubic feet of cargo space with rear seats folded. Powered exclusively by a 2.4-liter turbocharged FA24 flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, the Ascent comes standard with Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system and a TR690 Lineartronic CVT with eight simulated gears. Towing capacity is rated at up to 5,000 pounds—competitive for the segment. The exterior design incorporates Subaru's familiar styling cues including the hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, but scaled up to suit the vehicle's larger proportions. Inside, the Ascent offers a practical, family-focused interior with standard three-zone climate control, up to eight USB ports, 19 cup and bottle holders, and available features like a panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front seats, and second-row climate controls. Technology includes Subaru's Starlink infotainment system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility on a 6.5-inch or available 8-inch touchscreen. All models come standard with Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance package, which includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning, and lane-keeping assist. Trim levels include Base, Premium, Limited, and Touring, with the Onyx Edition introduced in 2022."

    description: "The Subaru Ascent received a significant mid-cycle refresh for the 2023 model year. The exterior features a new front fascia with updated grille design, new LED headlights with high-beam assist and C-shaped taillights. The most notable change is the interior, where the previous 6.5-inch and optional 8-inch infotainment displays have been replaced by a new vertical 11.6-inch touchscreen display, which becomes standard across all trim levels. The facelift also introduced the Cabin Connect interior microphone feature for better communication between front and rear passengers. Standard features were improved across the range, and all trims received enhanced technology packages. For 2024, updated Eyesight Technology was introduced along with new mirror designs featuring integrated turn signals. The 2025 model year brought the Bronze Edition and Onyx Edition Touring trim levels, while the base trim was discontinued. The powertrain remains unchanged, with the 2.4-liter turbocharged boxer engine producing 260 horsepower paired with Symmetrical AWD and CVT."
