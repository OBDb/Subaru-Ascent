    description: "The Subaru Ascent represents the Japanese automaker's largest vehicle and its re-entry into the three-row midsize crossover SUV segment after the discontinued Tribeca. Developed specifically for the North American market where larger family vehicles are in high demand, the Ascent is built on Subaru's global platform that underpins most of its modern lineup. Measuring approximately 196 inches in length, the Ascent offers seating for up to eight passengers (or seven with optional second-row captain's chairs) and up to 86.5 cubic feet of cargo space with rear seats folded. Powered exclusively by a 2.4-liter turbocharged flat-four 'boxer' engine producing 260 horsepower and 277 lb-ft of torque, the Ascent comes standard with Subaru's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system and a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with an eight-speed manual mode. Towing capacity is rated at up to 5,000 poundsâ€”competitive for the segment. The exterior design incorporates Subaru's familiar styling cues including the hexagonal grille and hawk-eye headlights, but scaled up to suit the vehicle's larger proportions. Inside, the Ascent offers a practical, family-focused interior with standard three-zone climate control, up to eight USB ports, 19 cup and bottle holders, and available features like a panoramic moonroof, heated and ventilated front seats, and second-row climate controls. Technology includes Subaru's Starlink infotainment system with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility on a 6.5-inch or available 8-inch touchscreen. All models come standard with Subaru's EyeSight driver assistance package, which includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning, and lane-keeping assist. A significant update for the 2023 model year brought refreshed exterior styling, a larger 11.6-inch vertical touchscreen, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the addition of Subaru's latest driver assistance technology, including a wide-angle mono camera to enhance the EyeSight system's field of view. The Ascent has positioned itself as a practical, safety-focused alternative in the competitive three-row crossover segment, appealing particularly to families who value all-weather capability, reliability, and safety over styling flair or performance dynamics."
